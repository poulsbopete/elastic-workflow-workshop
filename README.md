## Overview

Negative review campaigns are a universal problem affecting any platform with user-generated reviews—restaurants on Yelp, products on Amazon, apps in the App Store, hotels on TripAdvisor. Bad actors create fake accounts and submit coordinated fake reviews to manipulate ratings, damaging businesses and eroding consumer trust.

This workshop teaches participants to build a complete negative review campaign detection and response system using Elastic's latest features. **The same patterns work for any review system.**

**Workshop Duration:** 90 minutes

- Presentation & Demo: 30 minutes
- Hands-on Labs: 60 minutes

**Target Audience:**

- Trust & Safety teams
- Data analysts building search applications
- Developers implementing content moderation
- Solutions architects evaluating Elastic capabilities

| **Workflows** | SIMPLIFY + OPTIMIZE | Visual, no-code automation |
| **Agent Builder** | INNOVATE WITH AI | Natural language investigation |
| **ELSER Semantic Search** | INNOVATE WITH AI | Search by meaning, not keywords |

### Workshop Scenario

1. **Detect** - Identify abnormal review patterns using ES|QL (SIMPLIFY)
2. **Correlate** - Cross-reference with user trust scores via LOOKUP JOIN (OPTIMIZE)
3. **Automate** - Trigger workflows to protect businesses instantly (OPTIMIZE)
4. **Investigate** - Use Agent Builder for natural language analysis (INNOVATE WITH AI)
5. **Resolve** - Process incidents and restore business integrity

### Universal Applicability

The negative review campaign detection patterns in this workshop apply to ANY review system:

- 🍽️ **Restaurants:** Yelp, Google Business, TripAdvisor
- 🛒 **E-commerce:** Amazon, Home Depot, Walmart, Target
- 📱 **Apps:** App Store, Google Play
- 💼 **B2B:** G2, Capterra, Trustpilot
- 🏨 **Travel:** Booking.com, Airbnb, Hotels.com

### Automated Response Actions

When a negative review campaign is detected, the workflow automatically:
- **Protects business ratings** - Sets `rating_protected: true` to freeze displayed rating
- **Holds suspicious reviews** - Marks campaign reviews as `status: "held"` for manual review
- **Creates incidents** - Logs the campaign with severity classification (critical/high/medium/low)
- **Records actions** - Tracks all response actions taken for audit purposes

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elastic/elastic-workflow-workshop.git
cd elastic-workflow-workshop
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or: venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Elasticsearch credentials
```

```bash
# .env contents
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=https://your-cluster.es.cloud.elastic.co:443
ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### 4. Download Yelp Dataset

Download the Yelp Academic Dataset from https://www.yelp.com/dataset and extract to `data/raw/`:

```
data/raw/
├── yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
├── yelp_academic_dataset_user.json
└── yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
```

### 5. Prepare Workshop Data

```bash
cd admin
./prepare-data.sh
```

This script:

- Filters businesses to selected cities/categories
- Calculates user trust scores
- Partitions reviews into historical and streaming sets
- Generates synthetic attacker accounts and reviews
- Creates Elasticsearch indices
- Loads historical data

### 6. Verify Environment

```bash
python verify-environment.py

## Running the Demo

### Option 1: Web Application (Recommended)

The FastAPI web app provides a dashboard, attack simulator, and incident management UI.

```bash
# Start the web application
python -m app.main

# Access at http://localhost:8000
```

**Web App Features:**
- **Dashboard** - Real-time attack monitoring with auto-refresh
- **Attack Simulator** - Launch turbo attacks against target businesses
- **Incidents** - View and resolve detected incidents
- **Businesses** - Browse and search business data

**Key API Endpoints:**
```bash
# Launch attack (creates reviews + attacker users)
POST /api/reviews/bulk-attack?business_id=<ID>&count=15

# Run detection workflow (creates incident + executes response actions)
POST /api/incidents/detect?business_id=<ID>&hours=1

# Check business protection status
GET /api/businesses/<ID>

# List incidents
GET /api/incidents?business_id=<ID>
```

### Option 2: Streaming Application (CLI)

For CLI-based demos or automated testing.

```bash
cd streaming

# Replay legitimate reviews
python review_streamer.py --mode replay

# Inject attack reviews
python review_streamer.py --mode inject --business-id <BUSINESS_ID> --count 15

# Mixed mode (normal traffic, then attack)
python review_streamer.py --mode mixed --business-id <BUSINESS_ID> --normal-duration 60
```

The mixed mode runs normal traffic for a configurable period, then injects the attack automatically.

### Option 3: Agent Builder Setup (Quick Start)

Set up all Agent Builder tools and the investigation agent with a single command:

```bash
python admin/setup_agent_builder.py
```

This creates:
- **incident_summary** tool - ES|QL query for incident details
- **reviewer_analysis** tool - Attacker pattern analysis with risk levels
- **similar_reviews** tool - ELSER semantic search for attack narratives
- **Review Campaign Investigator** agent - Custom agent with all tools assigned

Options:
```bash
python admin/setup_agent_builder.py --delete   # Delete and recreate all resources
python admin/setup_agent_builder.py --dry-run  # Preview without making changes
```

## Workshop Customization

### Changing Target Cities

Edit `admin/filter-businesses.py`:

```python
CITIES = ["Las Vegas", "Phoenix", "Toronto"]  # Modify as needed
CATEGORIES = ["Restaurants", "Food", "Bars"]
```

### Adjusting Detection Thresholds

Edit `workflows/review-bomb-detection.yaml`:

```yaml
# Adjust these thresholds based on your data volume
| WHERE review_count > 10 AND avg_stars < 2.0 AND avg_trust < 0.4
```

### Modifying Attack Intensity

Edit `config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
injection:
  delay_before_attack_seconds: 60
  reviews_per_second: 15 # Increase for more dramatic demo
```

---

## Instruqt Deployment

### Publish the track

```bash
instruqt auth login   # once per machine
make publish          # from repo root: git push + validate + instruqt push (after git commit)
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd instruqt/review-bomb-workshop-serverless
instruqt track validate
instruqt track push --force
```

### Track configuration

`track.yml` + `config.yml` live under **`instruqt/review-bomb-workshop-serverless/`**. Edit metadata in **`instruqt/track-serverless.yml`** and sync to `review-bomb-workshop-serverless/track.yml` (or use **`make publish`**, which re-syncs after push).

See [`instruqt/README.md`](instruqt/README.md) for layout, secrets, and checksum notes.

### Serverless (search) track

The workshop runs on **Elastic Cloud Serverless (Elasticsearch)**. The Instruqt layout matches **[Elastic Autonomous Observability](https://play.instruqt.com/manage/elastic/tracks/elastic-autonomous-observability)** (`es3-api` + `elastic/es3-api-v2` + secrets), then runs `startup-serverless.sh` to bulk-load data and start the app.

- **Track root (push from here):** `instruqt/review-bomb-workshop-serverless/`
- **Track source / edits:** `instruqt/track-serverless.yml`
- **Bootstrap:** `track_scripts/setup-es3-api` → `instruqt/startup-serverless.sh`

See [docs/instruqt-serverless.md](docs/instruqt-serverless.md) for setup, connection requirements, and local Serverless runs.
